As this project is primarily a learning project, I am not currently accepting any active contributors. That said, if you happen to be learning the code and notice any typos, issues, or just places where my bad c++ can be improved, feel free to drop something in the issue tracker, would appreciate it.

This is subject to change if I ever get this project to a "releasable" state.
